Project overview

This goal of the game is to listen and count the number of buzzes and lights that appear. The sequence plays 10 times, randomising between playing a buzz or displaying an LED. You are then given a chance to input the number of buzzes and lights you think appeared. After every round, a green or red indicator will pop up to indicate if you are correct or not. Try to last as long as you can.
